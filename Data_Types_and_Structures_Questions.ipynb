              "'answers\\n#1:What are data structures, and why are they important? \\n      Answer := Data structures are just differrent ways to we can cretae variable/data that is organized, managed, and stored. \\n      They\\'re important because the choice of structure affects how fast and how efficiently a program runs. \\n      Picking the right one can greatly improve both time (speed) and space (memory usage) performence.\\n      1_list = [\"ParleG\", \"Maggi\", \"Nutella\"]  # Grocary list\\n      print(\"Q1 -Item List:\", 1_list)\\n\\n#2:Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\\n      Answer := mutable data types can be changed after  created, while imutable types cannot.\\n      Eg :- \\n  - List ([1, 2]) : you can add or change elemnts.\\n  - Dictionary ({\\'a\\': 1}) : keys and values can be updated.\\n  - String (\"hello\") : can\\'t be changed once created.\\n  - Tuple ((1, 2)) : also immutable.\\n  - Integer (5) : immutable too.\\n  If you modify a mutable object, it keeps  same memory address. But if you try to update an immutable data type, \\n  actually it creates a new variable with same name in memory.\\n  movies = [\"Mov1\", \"mov2\"]\\n      movies.append(\"Mov3\")  # added one more\\n      os_systems = (\"SLES\",\"Linux\", \"Windows\")\\n      print(movies, os_systems)\\n\\n#3:What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\\n      Answer := The main difference between lists and tuples is mutability:\\n  - Lists can be changed (mutable).\\n  - Tuples cannot (immutable).\\n  Use a list when the contents might change, and a tuple when data should stay fixed — like storing coordinates or constant records.\\n      numbers_list = [10, 20, 30]  uses square bracket\\n      numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30) tule has round brackets\\n      print(numbers_list, numbers_tuple)\\n\\n#4:Describe how dictionaries store data.\\n      Answer := Dictionary is the datatype that store data as in 2 parts one is key and every key is have value in pairs. key is a unique and immutable \\n      (like a string or tuple), while the value can be of any type. \\n      staff = {\"Inspector\": \"Kunal\", \"Constable\": \"Digvijay\"}\\n      print(staff[\"Inspector\"])\\n\\n#5:Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\\n      Answer := Use a set instead of a list when:\\n      1. unique items (removes duplicates)\\n      2. sets are fast than list data type.\\n      3. To perfoem operations like union, intersection, etc.\\n            genres = {\"Action\", \"Comedy\", \"Action\"}\\n            print(genres)\\n\\n\\n#6:What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\\n      Answer :=  String is an immutable sequence of characters.\\n      Main differences between strings and lists:\\n      a: Strings can store text only but lists can hold any type of data.\\n      b: Stringis immutable but lists are mutable.\\n\\n#7:How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\\n      Answer :=  Tuples used where data need some security because they\\'re immutable — after its created, tuples can\\'t be changed, added to, or deleted. \\n      tuple\\'s use case is like store students grade, some crutual employee data, security codes, etc\\n\\n#8:What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\\n       Answer := a hash table is a data structure implements an associative array of abstract data type, this data structure can map keys to values.\\n      it helps in fast data retrieval by computing an index (hash code) into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.\\n      dictionaries basically  use hashineg whaich is based on hash table. each key vaulue have unique hash code based on that data search and retrival is faster\\n\\n#9:Can lists contain different data types in Python?\\n      Answer := Yes, Python lists can hold different data types.\\n      Example: \\n      [(\"q\",\"z\"), 1, \"hello\", 3.14, [\\'a\\', \\'b\\']]\\n      This flexibility to hold any type of data makes lists very useful in many scenerios.\\n\\n#10:Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\\n      Answer :=  Strings are immutable mainly because of Speed, Hashing, Memory Optimization and Security.\\n      a. Efficiency: Immutable objects can be stored in a more memory-efficient way.\\n      b. Performance: It allows Python to reuse memory efficiently.\\n      c. Thread Safety: Multiple threads can safely use the same string.\\n      d. Hashability: Immutable objects can be used as dictionary keys.\\n      e. Safety: Immutable objects are inherently safer to use, as they cannot be changed unexpectedly.\\n\\n#11:What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\\n      Answer :=  Dictionaries have two big advatages over lists:\\n  1. Speed: Fast lookups using keys.\\n  2. Clarity: Keys act like labels, making code easier to read — e.g. person[\\'age\\'] is clearer than person[1].\\n\\n#12:Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\\n      Answer :=  A good time to use a tuple is when you have a fixed set of related values that shouldn\\'t change — like cordinates:\\n      coordinates = (34.0522, -118.2437)\\n      Using a tuple ensures you don\\'t accidently modify those values.\\n\\n#13:How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\\n      Answer :=  Sets automatically ignore duplicate values. If you try to add a duplicate, nothing happens. This makes sets great for keeping a collection of unique items.\\n\\n#14:How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\\n      Answer :=   When using the \\'in\\' keyword:\\n- In lists, it checks if a value exists anywhere in the list.\\n- In dictionaries, it checks if that value is a key in the dictionary.\\n\\n#15:Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\\n      Answer :=  No, you can\\'t modify elements of a tuple once it\\'s created — it\\'s immutable.\\n      Trying to do so gives a TypeError.\\n      But if a tuple contains a mutable element (like a list), you can modify that internal object, though not the tuple itself.\\n\\n#16:What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\\n      Answer :=  A nested dictionary is just a dictionary that holds other dictionaries as values.\\n      Example use: storing multiple user profiles.\\nuser_data = {\\n    \\'user_id_1\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'email\\': \\'alice@example.com\\', \\'status\\': \\'active\\'},\\n    \\'user_id_2\\': {\\'name\\': \\'Bob\\', \\'email\\': \\'bob@example.com\\', \\'status\\': \\'inactive\\'}\\n}\\n\\n#17:Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\\n      Answer :=  Accessing elements in a dictionary by key is usually very fast.\\n      In rare cases with hash collisions, it can slow down, but Python\\'s hashing system makes that unlikely.\\n\\n#18:In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\\n      Answer :=  Lists are a better choice than dictionaries when:\\n      1. The order of items matters.\\n      2. You just need a sequence of data, not labeled pairs.\\n      3. You mainly access elements by index not by key.\\n\\n#19:Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\\n      Answer :=   Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered, because hash tables didn\\'t preserve insertion order.\\n      Since Python 3.7, they do — but conceptually, dictionaries are still about key-based access, not position-based like lists.\\n\\n  #20:Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\\n      Answer :=  The main difference in data retrival:\\n\\n      - Lists are accessed using index numbers.\\n      - Dictionaries are accessed using keys.\\n      In short: use lists for ordered sequences, and dictionaries when you need key–value mapping.\\n\\n'"
